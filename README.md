# Bach to the Future
A classical music game that is played directly from a computer keyboard.

#### Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

## Motivation
To increase engagement with classical music works through the medium of a classical music rhythm game. Instead of passive listening, players can "tap along" to the melodies on their keyboard.

## Aim
To convert the wealth of classical MIDI files present today into a fun and educational game that people can interact with using Python 3.

## Features

| No | Feature | Function |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | User Interface (UI) | The entire premise of the game. Synchronising audio, visual elements with keystroke registration. |
| 2 | Difficulty Levels | To ensure the game is entertaining and progressive for all players of all skill levels. |
| 3 | Scoring System | A meaningful way to quantify the player's performance that rewards combo streaks and accuracy. |
| 4 | Achievements | To encourage players to strive for excellence or even seek out easter eggs. |
| 5 | Pausing and Resuming | To prevent untimely interruptions from causing players to lose progress and possibly to accommodate music tracks that are too long to realistically play in a single short session (about 10 minutes) |
| 6 | Saving | Provision of multiple user profiles |

## Implementation
#### Modules used: Mido, Pygame, concurrent.futures, time
### Extracting the melody
